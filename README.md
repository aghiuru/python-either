Python "Either" and "Maybe"
===========================

This is a fork of https://github.com/kennknowles/python-either (since I couldn't install the original one with pip3).

### Install

Add to `requirements.txt` file:

```git+git://github.com/aghiuru/python-either.git@master```

Then install with pip3:

```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
